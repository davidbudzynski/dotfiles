# Vertical window padding. This applies padding between the terminal cells and
# the top and bottom window borders. The value is in points, meaning that it
# will be scaled appropriately for screen DPI.
# 
# If this value is set too large, the screen will render nothing, because the
# grid will be completely squished by the padding. It is up to you as the user
# to pick a reasonable value. If you pick an unreasonable value, a warning
# will appear in the logs.
# 
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals,
# i.e. new windows, tabs, etc.
# 
# To set a different top and bottom padding, specify two numerical values
# separated by a comma. For example, `window-padding-y = 2,4` will set the
# top padding to 2 and the bottom padding to 4. If you want to set both
# paddings to the same value, you can use a single value. For example,
# `window-padding-y = 2` will set both paddings to 2.

# The following command checks if tmux is installed.
# If tmux is installed, it automatically attaches to an existing tmux session.
# If no tmux session exists, a new one is created.
# If tmux is not installed, it simply starts zsh without tmux.
#
# For this to work properly, you need to make sure that your shell is configured
# for homebrew, so you should have this line:
# eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
# In your ~/.zprofile file
# If you don't have that line, or if the file doesn't exist, run this:
# echo '' >>~/.zprofile && echo '# Configure shell for brew' >>~/.zprofile && echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >>~/.zprofile && eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
#
# This assumes you installed tmux through brew if using macos
